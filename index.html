						I am an engineer by trade, but I have an interest in a variety of fields, from medicine to tech to films and media. There are many things I like to do. I enjoy making short films; they are a lot of fun to work on. Coding is quickly becoming another favorite activity. On occasion, I will play videogames, but mainly, my freetime is spent with my family. I used to enjoy long drives, but now I prefer not long drives. Time is precious. 
					</p>

					<p class="p_main">
						Oh, I also love watching movies. My favorite movie is <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, but the best trilogy ever made is <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Anyone who says differently is wrong, just...wrong.

						There are only so many things that one can do without losing yourself in the music, the moment, you own it, you better never let it go. You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow. This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, you bett- SPAGHETTI, SPAGHETTI, SPAGHETTI!
